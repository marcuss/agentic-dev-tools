# Repository Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
- Multiple commits from incorrect user "marcuss-grindr" in the repository history
- Need for a clean, single commit with the correct user information

## Changes Made
1. **Repository Configuration**
   - Set local git user to "marcuss"
   - Used company email to avoid GitHub privacy restrictions
   - Updated remote URL to use token from environment variable

2. **Commit History Cleanup**
   - Created backup branch for safety
   - Reset to initial commit while preserving all changes
   - Created a single clean commit with all changes
   - Force pushed to update the remote repository

3. **Verification**
   - Confirmed remote repository now has only two commits:
     - Initial commit
     - Single squashed commit with correct author
   - Removed backup branch after successful verification

## Result
The repository now has a clean history with a single commit from the correct user "marcuss", containing all the Jira/Confluence connector code and security enhancements.
